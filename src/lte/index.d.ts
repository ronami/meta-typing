// Since TypeScript's type system has no concept of arithmetic, we try decreasing both `A`

// is the smaller one.

// This is relying on how we implemented the `Dec` method: If a value is out of scope (smaller
// than -1) we return `never`. Similarily to how the `-Infinity` value works in JavaScript.

// This type uses recursive (and not officially supported) type alias, see more:
// https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/26223#issuecomment-513187373.

  smaller: true;
  // None of them are `never`? Run again by decreasing both by 1:
  next: Lte<Inc<A>, Inc<B>>;
  // For example, calling Lte<9, 7> first checks if any of the values are `never`. Since that's
  // false, the recursion increases both by 1 and runs again with: Lte<10, 8>.
  //
  // Then again, since both numbers don't equal `never`, the recursion increases both by 1 and
  // runs again: Gte<never, 9>.
  //
  // Finally, after 10 was increased by 1 and went out of calculation range, it now has the value
  // of `never`. Because it reached the `never` value first, the recursion terminates and returns
  // `false`.
